Doffin web to sqlite scraper
============================

A system for converting the Doffin government web site for public
tenders into a local sqlite database.

It originated as a scraperwiki setup, but was moved where when the
community scraperwiki service was shut down.

A ruby scraper for Doffin used to notify about new tenders is
available from <URL:https://gist.github.com/ringe/db4c2fde97b9b8ae5fee >.
Perhaps someone  can use it for inspiration. :)

The latest version of this code can be found in
